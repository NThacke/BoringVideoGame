# BoringVideoGame

To execute this program, run the Play.java class in the terminal.

The program uses a .txt file to read and write the game's information on as a save/load feature. Playing the game will always create a new file if you do not load from a .txt file. If you load from a .txt file (or some other file type) that does not have the correct format, the game creates a new .txt file.

This is an attempt at creating a video game that uses a GUI and a Rest API. The purpose of this project was to practice programming skills, specifically
with larger programs. The actual video game created is not (for me) enjoyable to play. It is more of a program that demonstrates ability rather than something anyone would use or take notice of (in the sense that it's a video game -- it is much more like a program than something fun and interactive; alebit, programs are fun and interactive).
