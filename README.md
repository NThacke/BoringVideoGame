# BoringVideoGame
This is an attempt at creating a video game that uses a GUI and a Rest API. The purpose of this project was to practice programming skills, specifically
with larger programs. The actual video game created is not (for me) enjoyable to play. It is more of a useless program that demonstrates ability rather than something anyone would use or take notice of.
